# eyes-free-pong-game

As part of my Human Computer Interaction class, I developed an eyes-free, hands-free Python-based pong game centered around accesibility for users. 
In order to move the paddles, the user matches the pitch of their voice to the pitch emitted by the game. Instructions and audio cues 
are given to guide the player.
